/**
 * DOC: Resolve named Intel performance events to perf
 *
 * This library allows to resolve named Intel performance counter events
 * (for example INST_RETIRED.ANY)
 * by name and turn them into perf_event_attr attributes. It also
 * supports listing all events and resolving numeric events back to names.
 *
 * The standard workflow is the user calling "event_download.py"
 * to download the current list, and then
 * these functions can resolve or walk names. Alternatively
 * a JSON event file from https://download.01.org/perfmon
 * can be specified through the EVENTMAP= environment variable.
